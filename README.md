We are building an E-commerce Mobile Application with React Native. Firstly, before we get started with the app development process, be clear that we are going to build an e-commerce app with several basic features that require three functional screens:

1. Product Screen
The product screen is required to showcase all the product categories and services along with the image, title, and price on the app.
2. Product Details Screen
If users like a product or particular item, they will tap on the product page. The app takes the users to the product details and provides complete information such as quality, description, and more on the screen. Also, the details will be followed by the button to add the product to the shopping cart, when the user clicks the Add to card.
3. Final Shopping Cart Screen
The products and services that users added to their cart will be reflected on the shopping cart screen. Here users will see all the products that they wish to buy along with their name, quantity, subtotal and more.
So these are the three major screens of the e-commerce app that we will explain to build in this tutorial.
Let’s get started with the development process…
